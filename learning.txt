Channels

A Hyperledger Fabric "channel" is a private subnet of communication between
two ore more specific network members, for the purpose of conducting private
and confidential transactions.

A channel is defined by members (organizations), anchor peers per member, the
shared ledger, chaincode application(s) and the ordering service node(s).

Each transaction on the network is executed on a channel, where each party must
be authenicated and authorized to transact on that channel

Each peer that joins a channel, has its own identity given by a membership
services provider (MSP), which authenticates each peer to its channel peers and
services.

To create a new channel, the client SDK calls configuration system chaincode and
references properties such as:
  - anchor peers
  - and members (organizations)

This request creates a genesis block for the channel ledger, which stores
configuration information about the channel, policies, members and anchor peers.
When adding a new member to an existing channel, either this genesis block, or
if applicable, a more recent reconfiguration block, is shared with the new
member.

The election of a leading peer for each member on a channel determines which peer
communicates with the ordering service behalf of the other member. If no leader is
identified, an algorithm can be used to identify the leader.

The consensus service orders transactions and delivers them, in a block, to each
leading peer, which then distributes the block to its member peers, and across
the channel, using the gossip protocol.

Although any one anchor peer can belong to multiple channels, and therefor maintain
multiple ledgers, no ledger data can pass from one channel to another. This
separation of ledgers, by channel, is defined and implemented by configuration
chaincode, the identity membership service and the gossip data dissemination protocol.

This isolation of peers and ledger data, by channel, allows network members that
require private and confidental transactions to coexist with business competitors
and other restricted members, on the same blockchain network.
